# Name of the action
- name: TV
  # which paths to include - should be a glob pattern
  # e.g. **/*.ir
  include:
    - "Flipper-IRDB/TVs/**/*.ir"
  # rewrite changes the names of buttons to the key name if one of the values match
  # e.g. POWER: [ /^p(owe|w)r$/ ] -> if a button was named "PWR" before it would be renamed to "PWR"
  # NOTE: the values should be in lower-case, and they should not contain `_` or ` `
  rewrite:
    POWER: &tv-rewrites-power
      - onoff
      - offon
      # RegEx patterns should start and end with a "/" to treat them as regular expressions
      # NOTE: make sure you add ^ and $ to prevent rewriting buttons that _contain_ the pattern,
      # e.g. POWER: [ /pwr/ ] -> would rename `PWR` and `SHIPWRECKS` to `POWER`
      #      POWER: [ /^pwr$/ ] -> would rename only `PWR` to `POWER`
      - "/^p(owe|w)r$/"

# You can also replace any values using a simple find & replace:
- name: "Replace Underscores"
  include:
    - "Flipper-IRDB/**/*.ir"
  # if you want to exclude some files/directories, you can specify them using a glob pattern
  exclude:
    - "Flipper-IRDB/_Converted_/**/*.ir"
  # normally, files would be ignored if they have been handled by one of the above paths
  # setting ignore-previous to true forces to check the files again
  ignore-previous: true
  replace:
    # replace spaces with _
    # e.g. `Power On` -> `Power_On`
    - find: "/\\s+/"
      replace: "_"
      keys:
        - name
